raw:
If I can, I will and I won't worry about it.
If I set my mind to it and if I see it can be done, I'll get right on it.
If I decide it is reasonable and well within my strengths /n Or if I see it as a challenge, meant to test and motivate.
I'll do it if and when and while I can.
If my heart is in it, I won't stress it /n If my mind gets too heavy, I'll allow myself to rest it.
If I find it easy peasy, I'll help those who struggle If I think it quite difficult, I won't hide my troubles.
The most important thing to do is being honest with yourself If I can't, I'll say I'm sorry and I hope all is well.:
