By the next time I'm angry, I'll have learnt to find peace.
By the next time I'm blue, I'll have learnt to find hope.
When I laugh, I'll be laughing with all my heart.
When I cry, I'll be crying in all honesty.
When I breathe, I'll be tasting the sweet promise of life.
Whenever I am caught up in the twirling of stressful thoughts I'll be noticing that there's nothing wrong in being prepared.
I'll be offering a kind smile whenever I truly feel like it.
I'll be honest to myself and to those around me.:
